Upstream doesn't provide a tarball containing a buildable source tree. The zip
files monitored by the watch file contains a source jar with no build script.
To work around this issue the debian/orig-tar.sh has been added to fetch the
sources from the upstream SVN repository. This script is to be invoked by
calling the get-orig-source target of debian/rules.
